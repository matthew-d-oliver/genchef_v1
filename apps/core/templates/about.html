      <p class="p1">Two of my big passions in life are playing with new technologies, and cooking, So naturally when ChatGPT became hot in early 2023, the first prompts I asked it were for custom recipes. It was exceedingly proficient at generating unique requests with accurate measurements and also, was great at swapping ingredients. The ultimate test I gave it was a Cast Iron pan pizza, which had specific time &amp; ingredient requests, which was hard to create my own specific one from adapting many different recipes I found online to fit my equipment &amp; ingredients.<br>‍<br>The pizza came out great, and ChatGPT quickly became a core part of my recipe development process, whether it was checking how long to sear a steak or what the difference between green onion and scallions is.<br>I quickly through together a Flask App in AWS as a proof of concept, and then got to work on this site with Django &amp; Webflow, and (6+ months) later it was live!<br>‍<br>While other websites exist with similar purposes, and AI Chat tools might be easier for a quick cooking tip, my hope for this website is to help people become better chefs, and promote cooking with fresh ingredients. My other project that <em>pairs well</em> with this site is OliversGrocers.com, which promotes Local ingredients, check them out, and reach out with any questions/comments about the website!</p>
